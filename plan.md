# Plan

- [x] scheduled cron triggers a scheduled sync start log (verifies sync path runs)
- [x] scheduled sync failure sends a Telegram alert with the error message
- [x] scheduled sync completion logs a single summary line with key counts
- [x] cron renewal candidate requires renewCnt exactly 0 and due within 2 days
