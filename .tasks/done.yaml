# Example of completed task:
# - task_id: TASK-001
#   title: "Initialize Cloudflare Workers project"
#   completed_at: "2025-01-22T12:00:00Z"
#   outcome: success
#   summary: "Project initialized with all configurations"
#   learnings:
#     - "D1 binding requires specific wrangler.toml format"

- task_id: TASK-011
  title: "Post-build code audit and hardening recommendations"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T06:28:59Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-maintenance-001
  summary: |
    Completed a repository-wide audit after the first build. Identified stale
    renewal persistence, unsecured manual trigger endpoint, lack of retries and
    pagination in library client, timezone-sensitive date logic, and HTTP usage
    for Aladin API requests.
  learnings:
    - "Renewal workflow fetches charges twice and fails to persist renewed due dates/renewCnt."
    - "Manual /trigger endpoint is unauthenticated, enabling arbitrary runs."
    - "Library API calls need retries, timeouts, and pagination to avoid silent data loss."
    - "Date utilities assume local timezone; should be KST-aware."
    - "Aladin client should use HTTPS to avoid MITM and mixed-content issues."

- task_id: TASK-012
  title: "Persist renewed due dates and avoid duplicate charge fetch"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T06:32:40Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-renewal-001
  summary: |
    Avoided duplicate charges fetch by letting renewal reuse pre-fetched data and mutated
    charges in-memory to reflect renewed due dates/renew counts before persistence. Updated
    workflow to call checkAndRenewBooks with existing charges; added tests to verify no extra
    fetch and that charge objects are updated.
  learnings:
    - "Mutating the shared charges array after renewals keeps downstream persistence accurate."
    - "Passing charges into renewal function prevents redundant API calls."

- task_id: TASK-013
  title: "Secure manual /trigger endpoint"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T06:34:32Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-scheduler-001-sec
  summary: |
    Protected the manual /trigger endpoint with Bearer secret, added tests for missing/invalid/valid
    secrets, and documented TRIGGER_SECRET in env/types and wrangler vars. Workflow only starts when
    Authorization matches.
  learnings:
    - "Using a simple shared secret is the fastest guard; could swap to HMAC or SignedURL later."
    - "Tests must stub waitUntil to assert the job is enqueued without running network calls."

- task_id: TASK-014
  title: "Add retries, timeouts, and pagination to library client"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T06:38:42Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-auth-001
  summary: |
    Added resilience to library client: fetchWithResilience with timeouts/backoff, login retries,
    paginated charges retrieval, and retryable renewals. Tests cover pagination and 5xx retry.
  learnings:
    - "Retry loops must cap attempts precisely to avoid exhausting fetch mocks."
    - "Pagination combined with totalCount guards against silent truncation."

- task_id: TASK-015
  title: "Make date calculations timezone-safe (KST)"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T06:41:34Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-renewal-001
  summary: |
    Date utilities now use a timezone-aware day calculation (default KST, overrideable),
    renewal/new-book logic accepts offset, and tests cover KST day rollovers. This prevents
    off-by-one around UTC/KST midnights.
  learnings:
    - "Shifting by offset before day-flooring keeps logic independent of host timezone."
    - "Simple offset-shifted ISO splitting is a robust way to get date strings."

- task_id: TASK-016
  title: "Adjust /trigger to rely on Zero Trust (remove TRIGGER_SECRET)"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T06:46:00Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-scheduler-001-zt
  summary: |
    Removed in-worker Bearer secret requirement for /trigger; security will be enforced via
    Cloudflare Zero Trust/Access. Cleaned up env typings, wrangler vars, and secret tests.
  learnings:
    - "When Zero Trust guards the route, duplicate in-worker secrets add maintenance overhead."
    - "Manual trigger tests should focus on behavior, not auth, when auth is delegated."

- task_id: TASK-017
  title: "Add custom domain book.kadragon.work to worker routes"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T00:30:00Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-deploy-001
  summary: |
    Added a custom domain route for book.kadragon.work in wrangler.toml with traceability
    comments so deployments map the Worker to the requested hostname.
  learnings:
    - "Routes array with zone_name is sufficient when account has the zone; no code changes needed."
    - "Trace comments in config aid future auditing of domain mappings."

- task_id: TASK-018
  title: "Enable observability and Smart Placement"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T00:55:00Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-observability-001
  summary: |
    Enabled Smart Placement and configured observability with 100% log sampling and 10% trace sampling
    via wrangler.toml, with trace annotations for auditing.
  learnings:
    - "wrangler observability supports separate head_sampling_rate for logs and traces."
    - "Placement block with mode=smart lowers latency without code changes."

- task_id: TASK-019
  title: "Build bookshelf frontend and expose books API"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T17:10:00Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-frontend-001
  summary: |
    Added a bookshelf SPA served directly from the Worker assets binding, exposed /api/books with
    derived due status/daysLeft, implemented SPA fallback, and built a React-based grid UI with search
    and filters for author, due status, renew count, and loan state.
  learnings:
    - "Returning derived fields (dueStatus, daysLeft) keeps the frontend simple and predictable."
    - "Assets fallback via env.ASSETS.fetch plus index.html avoids html_handling quirks in wrangler."
    - "Using a single package.json still supports Vite builds when config is ESM (.mts)."

- task_id: TASK-020
  title: "Expose note metadata and UI CTA (stub)"
  completed_at: "2025-11-22T17:13:30Z"
  outcome: success
  spec_id: SPEC-notes-001
  summary: |
    Exposed noteCount/noteState fields from /api/books and surfaced a note CTA on cards to pave the way
    for future note storage. Kept values stubbed (0/not_started) pending persistence design.
  learnings:
    - "Including note metadata in the API now avoids a future contract change when persistence arrives."
    - "CTA can be present without functionality as long as semantics are explicit (not_started)."
