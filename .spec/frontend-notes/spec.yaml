title: "Book notes surfacing (stub)"
description: |

  - given: "The /api/books endpoint is requested"
    when: "Books are returned"
    then: "Each book includes noteCount and noteState fields (stubbed) so the UI can render note affordances"

    when: "They look at a book card"
    then: "They see a note CTA showing current note count and a prompt to add notes"
